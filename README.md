# 3D-Robotic-Arm-5DOF

This project features a custom-designed 3D robotic arm created and assembled using Tinkercad. The arm includes **five degrees of freedom (DOF)**, which allow it to simulate realistic robotic movements commonly used in industrial and automation systems.

The design reflects a clear understanding of joint functionality, structural balance, and motion flow — all organized into a clean and modular layout.

## Project Overview

The 5-DOF robotic arm includes:

- **Base Rotation (Yaw)** – Horizontal rotation of the full arm  
- **Shoulder Pitch** – Lifting and lowering the upper arm  
- **Elbow Pitch** – Bending the mid-arm forward and backward  
- **Wrist Pitch** – Tilting the wrist for better reach  
- **Wrist Roll (Gripper Rotation)** – Rotating the end-effector for alignment

Each joint adds a specific degree of freedom, allowing the arm to reach and orient objects in 3D space.

## Components (Assembled in Tinkercad)

- Cylindrical and box segments representing links  
- Hinge-style joints to allow rotation between parts  
- A gripper placeholder as the end-effector  
- A solid, stable base for arm support

The parts were carefully aligned and arranged to meet structural and movement requirements using Tinkercad’s 3D design tools.

## Applications

This model can be used as a foundation for:

- Learning robotic arm kinematics  
- Simulating basic pick-and-place operations  
- Exploring degrees of freedom in mechanical systems  
- Developing future control logic and actuation systems

## Future Enhancements

- Add servo motor simulation for joint control  
- Export design files for 3D printing  
- Connect with Arduino to build a working prototype  
- Test inverse kinematics using Python or MATLAB libraries

This rendered image shows the full structure of the 5-DOF robotic arm, including the rotating base, three main links, hinge-style joints, and the end-effector gripper. The color scheme — red (links), black (base), and silver (joints and gripper) — highlights each component clearly within the model.
